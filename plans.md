Purpose: Reward stillness and presence — the beauty of quiet love.

How it appears:

On any page, if she does nothing for 20–30 seconds, everything fades softly.

The screen turns dim. Then a whisper appears in elegant serif:

“You stayed.”
“Thank you for listening to the quiet.”

A secret short poem unfolds — one that never appears through normal interaction.

Optional Variation:

Different poems depending on where she triggers it — a “silent echo” unique to each layer.

When she exits silence (moves again), petals softly scatter, and the main view fades back.

Purpose: The heart of emotional growth.
Each letter represents a phase of love, understanding, or shared memory.

Implementation:

A beautifully minimal letterbox interface — each envelope floats in the air like a paper lantern.

Locked letters are dimmed, sealed with date ribbons (e.g., “Opens on: January 14, 2026”).

The open letters glow subtly, inviting her to click.

Interactions:

Clicking an available letter → typewriter reveal + ambient music cue.

After reading, the letter folds itself and floats upward (like it’s going back into the sky).

You could let her bookmark one — it glows softly next visit.

Technical Plan:

Store metadata (date, opened/unopened status) in localStorage or a minimal Supabase DB.

Use React state to unlock letters based on the real date.

Add a poetic hover:

“Every word finds its time.”
