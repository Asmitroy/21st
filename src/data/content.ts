export const letterContent = `My Dearest,

There are moments in life when words feel inadequate, when language itself seems too small to hold the weight of what we feel. This is one of those moments.

I've tried a thousand times to tell you what you mean to me, but every attempt falls short. How do I describe the way your presence calms the chaos in my mind? How do I explain that your laughter has become my favorite sound, or that your smile is the first thing I think of when I wake?

You are not just someone I love—you are the reason I understand what love truly is.

You've shown me that strength isn't about never falling; it's about getting back up every single time. You've taught me that honesty isn't harsh—it's the foundation of everything real. And you've proven that optimism isn't naivety; it's the bravest choice we can make.

In every small moment we've shared—the quiet evenings, the random conversations, the comfortable silences—you've woven yourself into the fabric of who I am. I am better because of you. I am whole because of you.

This isn't just a letter. It's a promise. A promise that no matter where life takes us, no matter what challenges we face, I will always see you. The real you. The you that exists beyond what the world sees.

You are my constant. My light. My home.

Forever, in every small thing.

Yours always.`;
